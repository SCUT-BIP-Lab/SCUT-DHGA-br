# SCUT-DHGA-br
SCUT-DHGA-br: A Synthetic Database for Dynamic Hand Gesture Authentication

## Short Information
SCUT-DHGA-br Database is used for scientific research of finger vein recognition. It is collected by BIP Lab, School of Automation Science and Engineering, South China University of Technology(SCUT). Any one or group is allowed to use this database free of charge.

## File Naming Convention
Images are labeled as follow: train/test_session_ID_gesture_sample.bmp,  
where “train/test” indicates whether the video sample belongs to the training set or the testing set ,
“session” stands for session number which can be "1" or "2"
"ID" stands for client's ID, 
“gesture” ranges from 1 to 6 standing for six gesture types,
“sample” stands for the repetitions of the sample, ranging from 1 to 10, 

The naming convention of SCUT-DHGA-br is same as the SCUT-DHGA database. please refer to https://github.com/SCUT-BIP-Lab/SCUT-DHGA for details.

## Request
The SCUT-DHGA-br is publicly available (free of charge) to the research community.  
Unfortunately, due to privacy reasons, we cannot provide the database for commercial use.

Those interested in obtaining SCUT-DHGA-br should download [release agreement](https://github.com/BIP-Lab/SCUT-DHGA-br/blob/master/SCUT%20FV%20Presentation%20Attack%20Database%20Release%20Agreement.pdf), and send by email one signed and scanned copy to scutbip@outlook.com.
